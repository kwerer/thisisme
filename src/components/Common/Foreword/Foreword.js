        I like to think of this website as an
        additional boost for my resume, while I
        believe that my resume does bring out some
        of my key achievements, I feel that
        finding the right fit for the job requires
        more than that. As I do not use social
        media platforms, I thought I would share a
        little more about myself here, some of the
        challenges I've faced and how I dealt with
        (or is dealing with) here.
